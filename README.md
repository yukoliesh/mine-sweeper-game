# Mine Sweeper Game Project

## Introduction
Hi, my name is Yuko Shiozaki and thank you for taking a time to interview me and review my code.

After I received my assignment, I had to google what the Mine Sweeper game is about.
Unfortunately, I've never played this game before so I had to watch some videos how they played and 
what the rules are. 

The basic rules are the following: to win this game, you avoid to click the hidden mines (bombs). 
If you think there is a mine, you put the flag with the right click. 

My game is very simple and basic, and there is no timer, or no scores.
