# Mine Sweeper Game Project

## Introduction
Hi, my name is Yuko Shiozaki and thank you for taking a time to interview me and review my code.

After I received my assignment, I had to google what is the Mine Sweeper game is about.
Unfortunately, I've never played this game before so I had to watch some videos how they played and 
what the rules are. 

The basic rules are the following: to win this game, you avoid to click the hidden mines (bombs). 
If you think there is a mine, you put the flag with the right click. 

My game is very simple and basic, and there is no timer, or no scores. 

### How to install and start this project on your local machine.

1. Clone from [yukoliesh/mine-sweeper-game](https://github.com/yukoliesh/mine-sweeper-game.git)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yukoliesh/mine-sweeper-game.git
    ```
2. Make sure the branch is `master` if not,
    ```bash
    git checkout master
    ```
3. Install this project
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
4. Start this project
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
5. You should be able to see my project at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Please let me know if you have any questions. I hope I will speak to you soon. Thanks! -Yuko

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
